# MinneHacks2026

For the theme "Mending Over Enidng," we are making an app to extend the lifespan of personal
devices. We will include features such as monitoring battery charge, battery usage, CPU and RAM
usage, device temperature, and storage usage. This will be used to offer recommendations to the
user to extend their device's lifespan.
